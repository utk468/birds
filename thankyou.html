    From anatomy to systematic taxonomy

    Conrad Gesner (1516–1565). His Historiae animalium is considered the beginning of modern zoology.

    The Renaissance was the age of collectors and travellers, when many of the stories were actually demonstrated as
    true when the living or preserved specimens were brought to Europe. Verification by collecting of things, instead of
    the accumulation of anecdotes, then became more common, and scholars developed a new faculty of careful
    observation.[21] The Renaissance brought expanded interest in both empirical natural history and physiology. In
    1543, Andreas Vesalius inaugurated the modern era of Western medicine with his seminal human anatomy treatise De
    humani corporis fabrica, which was based on dissection of corpses. Vesalius was the first in a series of anatomists
    who gradually replaced scholasticism with empiricism in physiology and medicine, relying on first-hand experience
    rather than authority and abstract reasoning. Bestiaries—a genre that combines both the natural and figurative
    knowledge of animals—also became more sophisticated. Conrad Gessner's great zoological work, Historiae animalium,
    appeared in four volumes, 1551–1558, at Zürich, a fifth being issued in 1587. His works were the starting-point of
    modern zoology. Other major works were produced by William Turner, Pierre Belon, Guillaume Rondelet, and Ulisse
    Aldrovandi.[22] Artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Leonardo da Vinci, often working with naturalists, were also
    interested in the bodies of animals and humans, studying physiology in detail and contributing to the growth of
    anatomical knowledge
