    In the 17th century, the enthusiasts of the new sciences, the investigators of nature by means of observation and
    experiment, banded themselves into academies or societies for mutual support and discourse. The first founded of
    surviving European academies, the Academia Naturae Curiosorum (1651) especially confined itself to the description
    and illustration of the structure of plants and animals; eleven years later (1662) the Royal Society of London was
    incorporated by royal charter, having existed without a name or fixed organisation for seventeen years previously
    (from 1645). A little later the Academy of Sciences of Paris was established by Louis XIV,[21] later still the Royal
    Society of Sciences in Uppsala was founded. Systematizing, naming and classifying dominated zoology throughout the
    17th and 18th centuries. Carl Linnaeus published a basic taxonomy for the natural world in 1735 (variations of which
    have been in use ever since), and in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.[24] While Linnaeus
    conceived of species as unchanging parts of a designed hierarchy, the other great naturalist of the 18th century,
    Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, treated species as artificial categories and living forms as malleableâ€”even
    suggesting the possibility of common descent. Though he was writing in an era before evolution was recognized,
    Buffon is a key figure in the history of evolutionary thought; his "transformist" theory would influence the
    evolutionary theories of both Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and
